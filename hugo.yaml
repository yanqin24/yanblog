    image: "/images/me.png"
    content: |-
      I am currently pursuing my Master of Engineering in Computer Software Engineering at Northeastern University (Seattle Campus), where I maintain a 4.0 GPA and focus on full-stack development, cloud deployment, and data-driven system design.

      I’ve previously worked at Meituan, OPPO, and BIGO, where I built scalable systems, designed A/B experiments, and developed full-stack applications that reached millions of users. My work ranges from creating AI-assisted web features and analytics dashboards to architecting microservice-based e-commerce and chatroom platforms deployed on AWS.

      I’m driven by curiosity and impact — I love transforming ideas into reliable, intuitive, and efficient digital products that improve how people live and interact with technology.
